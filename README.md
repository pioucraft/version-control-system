I NEED to define a timestamp in the main function that will be reused in the program whenever I do one action. WHY ?

Here's why:
1. I do a full commit.
2. IT will start by doing some simple commits with timespamp.
3. Some time passes and it does the full commit using new timestamps.
4. The timestamps are not the sames and things break.



# TODO:
1. Done?: Refactor this shit. Please. PLEASE !!!!!! This is really the most important part.
2. Add cat command
3. Add branching (with merging ofc)
4. There is no pull/push, BUT you can "rebuild" the filesystem acording to an existing branch
5. Add an init command

I NEED to define a timestamp in the main function that will be reused in the program whenever I do one action. WHY ?

Here's why:
1. I do a full commit.
2. IT will start by doing some simple commits with timespamp.
3. Some time passes and it does the full commit using new timestamps.
4. The timestamps are not the sames and things break.
